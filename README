The good folks over at Amped Wireless have an excellent usb adapter called the ACA1 which can be found at http://www.ampedwireless.com/products/aca1.html unfortunately they neglected to provide any linux driver support even though the device is really just generic hardware manufactured in taiwan using the rtl8812au chipset and re-branded as LoopComm, Edimax, Amped, etc.

A one line addition to a single file adding the vendor and product id information was really all that was needed to make this work. If this worked for you e-mail Amped at customerservice@ampedwireless.com and tell them to pay me for doing their job :-)
