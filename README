The good folks over at Amped Wireless have an excellent usb adapter called the ACA1 
which can be found at http://www.ampedwireless.com/products/aca1.html unfortunately they neglected to 
provide any linux driver support even though the device is really just generic hardware manufactured in taiwan
using the rtl8812au chipset and re-branded as LoopComm, Edimax, Amped, etc.

A one line addition to a single file adding the vendor and product id information was really 
all that was needed to make this work. If this worked for you e-mail Amped at
customerservice@ampedwireless.com and tell them to pay me for doing their job :-)

DISCLAIMER: If this driver causes anything negative to happen to your machine including but not limited to 
becoming self-aware, spewing molten capacitors in a jealous rage and attempting to sweet talk 
your significant other with the pornography and the soulful sounds of Maxwell's, For Lovers Only 
( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biECTo-0eTE ), I am NOT responsible.
